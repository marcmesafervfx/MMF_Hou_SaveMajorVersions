# MMF_SaveMajorVersions
Those two tools will allow you to save your scene with a proper naming increasing the version or take. The structure of the name is pretty basic: 'YourSceneName_v000_t000'. If you don't have the take and version previously, the tool will add it for you once clicked.

You can use it however you want to use it, but the idea is to major a version up once you do a cache or render.

The installation for this tool is going to be pretty simple:

- Copy the code that you have in the Fetch_Cache.py file and paste it inside a new tool that you can create on your custom shelf.
  - For better understanding, you'll need to create a new shelf. Then, you'll need to right click on top of it and select the new tool option.
  - Once you created it, go to the script tab and paste the code.
- If you want to be able to create the node using the tab key, you'll need to use the context tab from the tool and tick the SOP option.
- You can add a hotkey for the tool if you want.
  - In order to add it, you can edit the tool --> Hotkeys tab --> Global --> Edit
  - Search for the version ++ and create your own hotkey.
